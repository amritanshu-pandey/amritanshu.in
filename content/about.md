I am a software engineer with keen interest in creating tools to optimise development and release flows. I am currently working as an infrastructure engineer with focus on providing tools and infrastructure on cloud to improve observability and monitoring of SAAS applications.

I intend to write about my various tech related experiences and new learnings on this blog.

I could be reached out through github or twitter, links to those are available on my landing page i.e https://blog.amritanshu.in. 
Alternatively just shoot me an email on email@amritanshu.in.

Thanks for stopping by!
