I want to learn Kubernetes and I also want to improve my blogging skills and
online presence. Hence I have decided to kill two birds using one arrow and
blog about my experiences as I learn Kubernetes and do plenty of hands-on
exercises for the next 30 days.

There are a few rules to this challenge:
1. Write at least one post daily for the next 30 days
1. Blog posts should be informative and not be repetitive
1. Appear for the Kubernetes Certified Administrator exam by Cloud Native
   Computing Foundation (https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) and share
   my experience here

With the rules out of the way, let's talk about some of the use cases I want
to achieve using Kubernetes. In addition to appearing for the CKA exam,
I would also like to:

- Explore various ways of setting up self-hosted Kubernetes cluster   
- Transition my home lab to Kubernetes
- Explore the Kubernetes offerings by Google cloud platform and Amazon web services

I will update this blog post routinely to include the links to the daily
blog posts in this series.

More posts in this series:
1. Coming soon
