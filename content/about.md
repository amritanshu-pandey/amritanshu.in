I am a Python developer with deep interest in creating CI/CD and other Devops tooling.

I currently live in Sydney and work as a Devops engineer at my day job. By the evening and on weekends I could mostly be found either working on my various side projects or tinkering with my home lab or cloud with view of honing my devops skills.

I intend to write about my various tech related experiences and new learnings on this blog.

I could be reached out through github or twitter, links to those are available on my landing page i.e https://blog.amritanshu.in. 
Alternatively just shoot me an email on email@amritanshu.in.

Thanks for stopping by!
